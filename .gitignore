#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is customized by the user. In the case of an app, you might want to commit them.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail all together. If this is the case, it is recommended to ignore Pipfile.lock.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
